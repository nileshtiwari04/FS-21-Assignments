# Nested Comment Section

This project implements a nested comment section using **HTML**, **CSS** (Tailwind CSS), and **JavaScript**. It provides users with an interactive commenting experience where they can add new comments, reply to existing comments, edit and delete comments, and see a structured, multi-level thread format. It emulates a typical comment thread seen on social media platforms or forums.

## Features

- **Add Comments**: Users can add new comments to the main thread.
- **Reply to Comments**: Each comment has a reply button, allowing users to respond and create nested threads.
- **Edit Comments**: Users can edit their own comments or replies.
- **Delete Comments**: Comments and replies can be deleted.
- **Character Limit**: Comments and replies have a 250-character limit.
- **Real-time Character Counter**: Users can see the remaining character count while typing.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, with a clean and simple design.
- **Collapse/Expand Threads** (Optional): Option to add functionality to collapse or expand long threads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive layout.
